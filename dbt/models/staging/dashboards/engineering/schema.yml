    description: 'This table shows the duration of each training. Training duration
      encompasses both training and deployment. Training starts with the INSERT operation
      in the pm_classifieversion table and ends with the first UPDATE operation where
      status = "ready" and training_progress = 100. Training ends when the model is
      made available to the user. Training duration is NULL when the model was never
      made available to the user. '
