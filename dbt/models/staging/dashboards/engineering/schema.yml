    description: 'This table shows the duration of each training. Training duration
      encompasses both training and deployment. Training starts with the INSERT operation
      in the pm_classifieversion table and ends with the first UPDATE operation where
      status = "ready" and training_progress = 100. Training ends when the model is
      made available to the user. Training duration is NULL when the model was never
      made available to the user. Training duration is correlated with the number
      of data points that the model encompassed at the time of training and, in case
      of text data, with the average size of the data poin in terms of string length.'
